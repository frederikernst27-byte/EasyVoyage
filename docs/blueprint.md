## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#2E5DA8), evoking trust and stability, similar to the color of the ocean, sky and other places that are universally accepted to promote calm and peaceful feelings.
- Background color: Light blue (#D3E2F5), a lighter shade of the primary that's relaxing and professional. Dark scheme was avoided to reflect approachability and trust.
- Accent color: Teal (#32AFA6) to give a sense of balance. Given its equal distance to the primary color on the color wheel, this accent gives the interface harmony and the right dose of memorability to encourage click-throughs on conversion events such as Book Now buttons.
- Headline font: 'Playfair', a modern serif suitable for headlines, combined with PT Sans for the body.
- Simple and easily recognizable icons to represent various travel-related services, such as flights, hotels, and activities.
- Clean and organized layout with clear sections for each type of content. Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
- Subtle animations for transitions and interactions to add a layer of visual appeal without distracting from the user experience.
